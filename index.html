<h2>The article element</h2>

  <h3>Padma River</h3>
  <p>The Padma (Bengali: পদ্মা Pôdma) is a major river in Bangladesh. It is the main distributary of the Ganges, flowing generally southeast for 356 kilometres (221 mi) to its confluence with the Meghna River near the Bay of Bengal. The city of Rajshahi is situated on the banks of the river.</p>
</article>

<article>
  <h3>Meghna River</h3>
  <p>The Meghna River (Bengali: মেঘনা নদী) is one of the major rivers in Bangladesh, one of the three that form the Ganges Delta, the largest delta on earth, which fans out to the Bay of Bengal. A part of the Surma-Meghna River System, Meghna is formed inside Bangladesh in Kishoreganj District above the town of Bhairab Bazar by the joining of the Surma and the Kushiyara, both of which originate in the hilly regions of eastern India as the Barak River.</p>
</article>

<article>
  <h3>Jamuna River</h3>
  <p>The Jamuna River (Bengali: যমুনা Jomuna) is one of the three main rivers of Bangladesh. It is the lower stream of the Brahmaputra River, which originates in Tibet as Yarlung Tsangpo, before flowing into India and then southwest into Bangladesh. The Jamuna flows south and joins the Padma River (Pôdda), near Goalundo Ghat, before meeting the Meghna River near Chandpur. It then flows into the Bay of Bengal as the Meghna River.</p>

<h2>The audio element</h2>
<p>Details and functionality of this part will be demonstrated later</p>

<audio controls>
    <source src="listen_to_it.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio tag.
</audio>
<br>


<h2>HTML b Tag</h2>

<p> This tag makes some text bold (without marking it as important): </p>

<p>This is normal text - and <b>This is bold text</b>.</p>

<br>

<h2>The audio element</h2>
<p> The base tag specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a document and since there can only be one single base element in a document, and it must be inside the head element, this functionality will be demonstrated by creating another page where all url links will point to one target. Doing it here will wreck existing links on this page.</p>
<br>



<h2>The bdi element</h2>
<p>BDI stands for Bi-Directional Isolation.

The bdi tag isolates a part of text that might be formatted in a different direction from other text outside it.</p>

<p>In the example below, usernames are shown along with the number of points in a contest. If the bdi element is not supported in the browser, the username of the Arabic user would confuse the text (the bidirectional algorithm would put the colon and the number "90" next to the word "User" rather than next to the word "points").</p>

User <bdi>hrefs</bdi>: 60 points
User <bdi>jdoe</bdi>: 80 points
User <bdi>إيان</bdi>: 90 points

<br>

<h2>The bdo element</h2>
<p>BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override. The bdo tag is used to override the current text direction.</p>

<p>This paragraph will go left-to-right.</p>  
<p><bdo dir="rtl">This paragraph will go right-to-left.</bdo></p>  

<br>

<h2>The blockquote element</h2>
<p>The blockquote tag specifies a section that is quoted from another source.</p>

<p>Here is a quote from Wikipedia's website:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamuna_River_(Bangladesh)">
The Jamuna River (Bengali: যমুনা Jomuna) is one of the three main rivers of Bangladesh. It is the lower stream of the Brahmaputra River, which originates in Tibet as Yarlung Tsangpo, before flowing into India and then southwest into Bangladesh. The Jamuna flows south and joins the Padma River (Pôdda), near Goalundo Ghat, before meeting the Meghna River near Chandpur. It then flows into the Bay of Bengal as the Meghna River.

<h2>The body element</h2>
<p>The body tag defines the document's body. The body element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. There can only be one body element in an HTML document. </p>


<br>

<h2>The br tag</h2>
<p>The br tag inserts a single line break. The br tag is an empty tag which means that it has no end tag. </p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>Can you see the three line breaks?</p>
